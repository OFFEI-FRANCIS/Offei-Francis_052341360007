                The Faculty of Applied Sciences and Technology was established by separating it from the original
                Faculty of Applied
                Sciences in October 2016. The decision to rename the faculty was motivated by the intention to introduce
                new programs
                related to technology and to enhance the effective administration of the existing ones within the
                institution.
